# Surfs Up

### Overview 
In this module we used SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Flask, and Python to extract data from a csv file containing weather data for Oahu, and use it to present to an investor, hoping that 
he will be able to support our idea in opening a surf and ice cream shop on the island.

### Results
Our results show that the weather in Oahu is very consistent, in June the average temperature was 74.9 degress and in December it was 71.0 degrees.
However in June, we had 1700 data points and in December we had 1517 data points. While this is not a huge difference, it could have slightly skewed the data since we do not 
have the same amount of data for both months. A third point to make with our analysis is that the minimum temperature was the biggest change during these months. In June the minumum
temperature was 64 degrees and in December it was 56 degrees. 64 degrees is bearable to go surfing, but 56 degrees seems like it might be pushing it, even with a wet suit. This is 
definitely something we have to take into consideration in our business, and maybe adjust our hours to optimize when people are most likely to rent surfing equiptment and get
ice cream.

### Summary
In conculsion, both June and Decmber temperatures were relatively consistent, making it a perfect place to open a surf and ice cream shop.
In addition to the temperature of both months, I would include the amount of precipitation in both months, like we did during the module, because if it is a particularly rainy month,
that would definitely be a contributing factor in how much ice cream is sold. 
Another query I would run is the waves in Oahu. I have never been surfing, but if there are certain months or times in the year where the waves are better for surfing, we would 
have to plan for that and adjust for that and adjust our business accordinly. This would also pertain to the opposite, during times where waves are not ideal for surfing, we might
have to ramp up ice cream sales to offset the lower amount of surfing equiptment rentals.
